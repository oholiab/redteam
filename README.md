## Wat
I work in defensive infrastructure security, but I don't know as much as I'd
like about red-teaming methodology. This is my public attempt to learn what I
can in order to come up with defensive methodologies!

## Structure

```
.
├── hooks
│   └── ...
├── plan.org
├── README.md
└── server
    ├── ansible
    │   └── ...
    └── terraform
        └── ...
```

`plan.org` - my notes in .org format
`README.md` - this file
`hooks/...` - git hooks that are used in a directory so you can see them :)
`server/...` - red teaming server setup automation
`server/ansible/...` - server configuration
`sserver/terraform/...` - server instantiation

There are more READMEs in some of the subdirectories!
